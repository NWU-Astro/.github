## NWU Astrophysics and Space Research Group

The NWU Astrophysics and Space Research group, led by Prof. Christo Venter, focuses on theoretical modelling, numerical simulations, and observational 
analysis of high-energy astrophysical systems, with particular emphasis on pulsars, magnetars, compact objects, and transient phenomena. Core research 
activities include magnetospheric structure and particle transport modelling, radio and high-energy emission mechanisms, radiation processes such as 
curvature, synchrotron and inverse Compton emission, pulse profile and timing analysis, and end-to-end data processing pipelines for multi-wavelength 
observations. The group also actively develops machine learning approaches for population studies and computational acceleration, alongside cascade 
simulations and polarisation modelling to connect physical theory with observable signatures across the electromagnetic spectrum.
